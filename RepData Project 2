## Synonpsis 
We will analyze the impact of different weather events on public  health and economy using the storm database collected from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 1950-2011. This report employs an exploratroy anlysis to find which types of events are the most harmful to public health and economy using the estimates of injuries,fatalities, property and crop damage. We find that tornado is the most harmful with respect to population health, while flood have the greatest economic consequences. 

##Data Processing 

###First, we download the data file and unzip it.

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/rli/Documents")
url = "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
download.file(url, dest = "storm.bz2")
data = read.csv(bzfile("storm.bz2"))
```
The required packages are plyr and ggplot2:
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

##Impact on Population Health

###In this section, we check the number of injuries and fatalities that are caused by the severe weather events. We would like to get 5 most severe types of weather events.

Injuries 
```{r}
library(plyr)
injuries = ddply(data, .(EVTYPE), summarize, sum.injuries = sum(INJURIES,na.rm=TRUE))
injuries = injuries[order(injuries$sum.injuries, decreasing = TRUE), ]
head(injuries, 5)
```
This can be represented in the below figure:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(injuries[1:5, ], aes(EVTYPE, sum.injuries, fill = EVTYPE,alpha=0.5)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("Event Type") + ylab("Number of Injuries") + ggtitle("Injuries by Event type") + coord_flip()
```

We see that tornado is the most harmful event with injuries of more than 91 thousands

Fatalities
```{r}
fatalities = ddply(data, .(EVTYPE), summarize, sum = sum(FATALITIES))
fatalities = fatalities[order(fatalities$sum, decreasing = TRUE), ]
head(fatalities, 5)
```
This can be represented in the below figure: 
```{r}
ggplot(fatalities[1:5, ], aes(EVTYPE, sum, fill=EVTYPE,alpha=0.3)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("Event Type") + ylab("Number of Fatalities") + ggtitle("Fatalities by Event type") + coord_flip()
```

We see that it is tornado again with fatalities of more than 5 thousands followed by excessive heat causing close to 2 thousands fatalities.

##Impact on Economy 

###In this section, we check the number of property damage and crop damage that are caused by the severe weather events


Property damage 
```{r}
unique(data$PROPDMGEXP)
data$PROPDMGEXP <- toupper(data$PROPDMGEXP)
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP %in% c("", "+", "-", "?")] = "0"
```
we convert ‘B’ standing for billions to 9, ‘M’ standing for millions to 6, ‘K’ standing for thousands to 3 and ‘H’ for hundreds to 2.
```{r}
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP %in% c("B")] = "9"
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP %in% c("M")] = "6"
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP %in% c("K")] = "3"
data$PROPDMGEXP[data$PROPDMGEXP %in% c("H")] = "2"
```
Now we get the full property damage by converting PROPDMGEXP to numeric values and calculating total damage by multiplying the damage by the corresponding exponent.
```{r}
data$PROPDMGEXP <- 10^(as.numeric(data$PROPDMGEXP))
damage.property = data$PROPDMG * data$PROPDMGEXP
data=as.data.frame(cbind(data,damage.property))
```
We would like to get 5 most severe types of weather events
```{r}
Damage.property = ddply(data, .(EVTYPE), summarize, damage.property = sum(damage.property, na.rm = TRUE))
Damage.property = Damage.property[order(Damage.property$damage.property, decreasing = T), ]
head(Damage.property)
```

We see that Flood is the major damaging event for property damage with a total amount of more than 144 billion followed by hurricane/typhoon and tornado.

Now we get the crop damage using the same methodology as property damage
```{r}
unique(data$CROPDMGEXP)
data$CROPDMGEXP <- toupper(data$CROPDMGEXP)
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP %in% c("", "?")] = "0"
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP %in% c("B")] = "9"
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP %in% c("M")] = "6"
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP %in% c("K")] = "3"
data$CROPDMGEXP[data$CROPDMGEXP %in% c("H")] = "2"
data$CROPDMGEXP <- 10^(as.numeric(data$CROPDMGEXP))
damage.crop = data$CROPDMG * data$CROPDMGEXP
data=as.data.frame(cbind(data,damage.crop))
Damage.crop = ddply(data, .(EVTYPE), summarize, damage.crop = sum(damage.crop, na.rm = TRUE))
Damage.crop = Damage.crop[order(Damage.crop$damage.crop, decreasing = T), ]
head(Damage.crop,5)
```
We see that drought is the major damaging event for crop causing more than 13 billion dollars followed by flood. 

Now we add property damage and crop damage together to decide which event is the most damaging 
```{r}
total.damage = damage.property + damage.crop
data=as.data.frame(cbind(data,total.damage))
Damage.total = ddply(data, .(EVTYPE), summarize, damage.total = sum(total.damage, na.rm = TRUE))
Damage.total = Damage.total[order(Damage.total$damage.total, decreasing = T), ]
head(Damage.total,5)
```
We see that it is flood is the most damaging weather in terms of total damage with  more than 150 billions followed by hurricane/typhoon 

## Result
Based on the above exploratory analysis, we found that tornado is the most damaging event for population health while flood is the most damaging factor for economic loss. But if crop is the main concern, drought is the most damaging factor.
